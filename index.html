        <h2>Why Study Buddy?</h2>
        <p>Many people have never developed good learning habits. These individuals may want to study, but may not know
            how to
            effectively do so. They also may simply get distracted in today's fast moving society. We aim to provide
            these
            people a resource to help them stay on track. In addition, we want to provide a resource for people in
            underserved
            communities who might not be receiving treatment for a learning disability.
        </p>

        <p>
            Study Buddy is an app which helps individuals who want to form better study habits to do so by giving them a
            resource to help promote studying, remember events, and start to build patterns in which they’re effectively
            studying.
        </p>

        <p>This will help achieve Sustainable Development Goal #4: Quality Education.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">This is an important problem because of the large volume of students
                            pursuing a higher education
                            and their ability to learn effectively. Also adults who are returning from the workforce
                            could have lost their study
                            habits from previously schooling could benefit from this. Globally there are students and
                            others who could benefit
                            from better study habits.

                            world could use this
                            application. They should care because it is proven that better study habits lead to improved
                            academic performance. About 19.9 million students enrolled in higher education in fall 2019

                            <h5 class="card-title">How do we solve this?</h5>
                            <p class="card-text">The web app we want to develop isn't designed to help study a specific
                                subject. Instead it is a
                                tool for learning the best way for an individual to learn, as well as encouraging good
                                study habits to be successful
                                in academics. Our goal is to help students learn and reinforce consistent study habits.
                                Our app does a number of
                                things to achieve this such as: provide a way for users to add events (such as a study
                                group), a calendar to view
                                said events, and a page to go to when you are studying. This promotes studying for
                                longer periods of time and should
                                help students excel in their work.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Initially, we had tried to design it to be quite different. We wanted to
                            implement a “Study Type
                            Quiz” and based on the results of this, push users in different directions. This was quite a
                            unique solution;
                            however being scarce on time, we weren’t able to implement this. Due to the time limit, our
                            finished solution is
                            fairly similar to many existing solutions.

                This was our final prototype design. It displays a number of screens. We had originally planned possibly having a
                virtual tour of the app, upon first log in, hence the “Take the Tour” screen on the bottom left. On top of that was
                the home screen. It is the epicenter of the app and gives access to other pages, as well as some friendly
                inspiration. The next two to the right of that were the plans for the creating new event page and the calendar where
                it was displayed. We ended up going with a different calendar API then google’s knowing we wouldn’t want to have to
                purchase API keys. The two screens under those are the Time To Study and Timer pages. These ended up being
                implemented extremely similarly to how they were planned! Finally, on the right side, you can see some plans for
                notifications. This would be another thing that we’d love to implement if we had more time.
