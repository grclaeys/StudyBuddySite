Many people have never developed good learning habits. These individuals may want to study, but may not know how to effectively do so. They also may simply get distracted in today's fast moving society.  We aim to provide these people a resource to help them stay on track. In addition, we want to provide a resource for people in underserved communities who might not be receiving treatment for a learning disability.
