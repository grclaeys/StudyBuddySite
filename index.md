Many people have never developed good learning habits. These individuals may want to study, but may not know how to effectively do so. They also may simply get distracted in today's fast moving society.  We aim to provide these people a resource to help them stay on track. In addition, we want to provide a resource for people in underserved communities who might not be receiving treatment for a learning disability.

This is an app which helps individuals who want to form better study habits to do so by giving them a resource to help promote studying, remember events, and start to build patterns in which theyâ€™re effectively studying.

This will help achieve Sustainable development goal #4: Quality Education.

This is an important problem because of the large volume of students pursuing a higher education and their ability to learn effectively. Also adults who are returning from the workforce could have lost their study habits from previously schooling could benefit from this. Globally there are students and others who could benefit from better study habits.

Any student, or individual who is trying to learn how to study, in the world could use this application. They should care because it is proven that better study habits lead to improved academic performance.

The web app we want to develop isn't designed to help study a specific subject. Instead it is a tool for learning the best way for an individual to learn as well as how to form good study habits and be successful in academics. Our goal is to help students learn and reinforce consistent study habits. Our app does a number of things to achieve this such as: provide a way for users to add events (such as a study group), a calendar to view said events, and a page to go to when you are studying. This promotes studying for longer periods of time and should help students excel in their work.
